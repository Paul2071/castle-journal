This web app is deployed at the following https://vue-firebase-backend-22e0c.firebaseapp.com/

I had a lot of fun making this and will keep supporting it and possibly adding features in the future:

### Roadmap

- Mobile view needs looking at. Responsiveness etc.
- Overview of the CSS, font sizes, colour scheme in particular
- ~~ Images seem to be a little off, they dont focus on the centre of the image ~~
- pagination 
- search function
- leave comments
- star review?
